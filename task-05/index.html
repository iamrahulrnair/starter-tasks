            Been watching his movies from childhood, became a huge fan when iron
            man released, His journey from as a drug addict to one of the
            highest paid actors in hollywood been such an inspiration for me. He
            is a good actor , a good philanthropist, and a wonderful people
            person. These qualities are rare to find among the celebrities these
            days, this also boosts my admiration to him ðŸ˜‰.
